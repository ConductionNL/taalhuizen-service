Installation
----
We differentiate between two way's of installing this component, a local installation as part of the provided developers toolkit or an [helm](https://helm.sh/) installation on an development or production environment.

#### Local installation
First make sure you have [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) running on your computer. Then clone the repository to a directory on your local machine through a [git command](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) or [git kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) (ui for git). If successful you can now navigate to the directory of your cloned repository in a command prompt and execute docker-compose up.
```CLI
$ docker-compose up
```
This will build the docker image and run the used containers and when seeing the log from the php container: "NOTICE: ready to handle connections", u are ready to view the documentation at localhost on your preferred browser.

#### Instalation on Kubernetes or Haven
As a haven compliant commonground component this component is installable on kubernetes trough helm. The helm files can be found in the api/helm folder. For installing this component trough helm simply open your (still) favorite command line interface and run
```CLI
$ helm install [name] ./api/helm --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml --namespace [name] --set settings.env=prod,settings.debug=0,settings.cache=1
```
For an in depth installation guide you can refer to the [installation guide](/api/helm) contained with the helm files, it also contains a short tutorial on getting your cluster ready to expose your installation to the world
